            <p>
                hash function is a mathematical algorithm that takes an input and produces output as a fixed-size 
                string of characters, which is typically a hexadecimal or binary representation. This output is 
                known as the hash value or hash code. now a days we have differend hashing method like md5 ssha 
                sha-1 sha-256 bcrypt and if we want to rank them based on security: ðŸ¥‡bcrypt ðŸ¥ˆsha-256 ðŸ¥‰ssha

            <p>
                I developed this website from the ground up, handling every aspect including backend, frontend, database management, and SEO. Utilizing Django for the backend and Django Rest Framework (DRF) for the API, I ensured robust functionality and performance. For testing, I implemented pytest and the pytest-django plugin. The database is managed with Django's ORM and SQLite. On the frontend, I employed HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Bootstrap to create a modern and responsive interface.

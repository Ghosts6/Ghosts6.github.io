            <p>
                hash function is a mathematical algorithm that takes an input and produces output as a fixed-size 
                string of characters, which is typically a hexadecimal or binary representation. This output is 
                known as the hash value or hash code. now a days we have differend hashing method like md5 ssha 
                sha-1 sha-256 bcrypt and if we want to rank them based on security: ü•ábcrypt ü•àsha-256 ü•âssha
